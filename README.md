# Linear-Programming-Simplexe
## How to solve a linear programming problem using Python and SciPy

This project has 3 main scenarios, each with a specific narrative concerning whether the maximization or the minimization of the profit/cost

## Scenario 1 : Script 1 

An entreprise want to make a product using 3 different techniques combining machines and human labor

** First Technique : 0.5 hours of machine and 2 hours of human labor
** Second Technique : 1.5 hours of machine and 1.5 hours of human labor
** Third Technique : 2 hours of machine and 0.5 hours of human labor

We can only use machines for 12 hours and human labor for 15 hours

After selling the product, we gain 3 Dhs using the 1st technique, 4 Dhs using teh 2nd and 5 Dhs using the 3rd technique

## Scenario 2 : Script 2

A clothes factory wants to maximize Its profit making suits

** First model : It needs 1 meter of Tissue, 4 hours of work and gets us 24 Dhs of profit
** Second model : It needs 2 meters of Tissue, 2 hours of work and gets us 16 Dhs of profit

Keep in mind that the factory has 150 meters of tissues and can only provide 400 hours of work.
The final goal is for them to sell all of their products. How many lots of 10s must the factory produce to mazimize theri gain ? 


## Scenario 3 : Script 3
